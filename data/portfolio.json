  "aboutpara": "Developer with a background in industrial engineering, seeking to add work experience in the field of computing. My professional career has developed in the area of â€‹â€‹maintenance within the pharmaceutical and food industry, where I have participated in projects to redesign productive equipment, integrating sensors, actuators, PLCs and artificial vision systems that have increased the efficiency and quality of the production process. \n\nThis led me to enter the world of programming and find a true passion there. I started self-taught with Python and artificial intelligence libraries. Later, I expanded my knowledge by completing Fullstack Development courses. I am currently deepening my knowledge in backend development (NodeJS, Typescript, SQL and non-SQL databases, etc.), participating in collaborative projects where, in addition to enriching myself personally and technically, interacting with people from all over Latin America with the most diverse backgrounds, I have strengthened my knowledge of Git and agile methodologies.\n\nI would love the opportunity to be part of an innovative organization where I can apply my knowledge to create new solutions or improve existing ones. I like to work as a team, contribute creative ideas and be available to collaborate at any time. My personality leads me to always be open to exchange and criticism that allows me to grow both professionally and personally. I am always willing to learn and contribute to the success of my team and organization.",
